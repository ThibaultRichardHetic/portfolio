# ALLEY OOP

Alley Oop is a game created by team n°6 as part of the back development week.

It is an online game based on actual NBA data. The principle is to create your team to face your friends' team. To win, use players who have a chance to score in the next game. If one of your players puts a basket in real life, you will have a basket in the game. You'll get the results every day after the game.
